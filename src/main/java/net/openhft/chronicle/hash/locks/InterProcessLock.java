/**
 * An inter-process lock, used to control access to some shared off-heap resources of {@link
 * ChronicleHash} instances.
 * <p>
 * <p>This lock is not reentrant, but kind of "saturating": multiple {@link #lock()} calls have
 * the same effect as a single call. Likewise {@link #unlock()} -- multiple unlocks, or unlocking
 * when the lock isn't actually held, has no negative effects.
 * <p>
 * <p>Once a lock object obtained, it <i>shouldn't be stored in a field and accessed from multiple
 * threads</i>, instead of that, lock objects should be obtained in each thread separately, using
 * the same call chain. This is because since the lock is inter-process, it anyway keeps it's
 * synchronization state in shared off-heap memory, but restricting on-heap "view" of shared lock
 * to a single thread is beneficial form performance point-of-view, e. g. fields of the on-heap
 * {@code InterProcessLock} object shouldn't be {@code volatile}.
 * <p>
 * <p>Lock is inter-process, hence it cannot afford to wait for acquisition infinitely, because
 * it would be too dead-lock prone. {@link #lock()} throws {@code RuntimeException} after some
 * implementation-defined time spent in waiting for the lock acquisition.
 * <p>
 * <p>{@code InterProcessLock} supports interruption of lock acquisition (in {@link
 * #lockInterruptibly()} and {@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)} methods).
 *
 * @implNote Inter-process lock is unfair.
 * @see InterProcessReadWriteUpdateLock
