The following stress test is provided for Chronicle Map Enterprise Edition. The test can be configured to run across multiple machines, with varying read/write workloads.

NOTE: This document assumes that you have access to the restricted https://github.com/ChronicleEnterprise/Chronicle-Map-Enterprise-Demo[Chronicle-Map-Enterprise-Demo] repository.

== Single master, multiple slaves

To execute a test, open the the `Example4` folder, and then execute the following command from a `bash` shell:

[source,bash]
....
$ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml
....

This command runs a test, using the specified configuration, which models a single master
node working with three slave nodes. All nodes run within the same JVM for simplicity.

The test reports throughput metrics in terms of reads, writes, and network traffic. For example:

[source,bash]
....
Write stress-test-1: 237 inserts/sec, 702 updates/sec (total 940/sec)
Read stress-test-2: 2175 reads/sec, 0.00% were null
Read stress-test-3: 2177 reads/sec, 0.00% were null
Read stress-test-4: 2176 reads/sec, 0.00% were null
Node 3 received 1061 events/sec, 151KB/sec from remote 1
Node 2 received 1062 events/sec, 151KB/sec from remote 1
....

Every minute, the test pauses the writer, and checks that all maps within the cluster
contain the same data; that is, they all have the same `keySet`, and the value for each key is
identical throughout the cluster. For example:

[source,bash]
....
Starting map checker due to time of 11:37:30.035
Checking maps for equality
All maps contained the same data
....

== Running the test in multiple JVMs

To spread the workload over multiple JVMs, use the `-h` parameter, which specifies the nodes that should be started in a particular JVM. The `singleMasterStressTest.yaml` configuration file contains 4 nodes (1 master, 3 slaves). The example below spreads these nodes across two processes.

. On one terminal, run the following command:

 [source,bash]
 ....
 $ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml -h 1 -h 2
 ....

+
then wait for the message notifying that the test is starting:

 [source,bash]
 ....
 Built stress test artifacts, running test..
 ....

. On another terminal, run the following command:

 [source,bash]
 ....
 $ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml -h 3 -h 4
 ....

+

In both terminals, throughput and map-equality checking will be reported.

== Multiple masters, multiple slaves

To test a multi-master scenario, where several different nodes are written to, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
....
./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/multipleMasterStressTest.yaml
....

== Test configuration

Stress test scenarios are configured using the supplied `yaml` file. Using the examples
included in this repository as a template, it is possible to configure custom scenarios
to model real-world workloads.

The configuration is comprised of two components:

1. Test parameters
2. Cluster configuration

Test parameters are described below:

[source,yaml]
....
!TestAndClusterConfig {
  testConfig: !StressTestConfig {
    numberOfSlaveNodes: 3,      # map instances that are read from
    numberOfMasterNodes: 1,     # map instances that are written to
    updatesPerSecond: 1000,     # writes per instance per second
    queriesPerSecond: 2500,     # reads per instance per second
    insertToUpdateRatio: 0.25,  # ratio of remove/insert vs update operations
    keySpaceSize: 5000,         # size of the key space (uniform random integers)
    valueSizeInBytes: 128,      # payload size of value object
    testLengthMinutes: 2        # duration of a test
  },
....

== Running tests across multiple physical machines

To demonstrate how to run tests across different machines, the following details are defined:

Hosts within the cluster:

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|=======================================
| host  |  host_id  | IP       | role
|   A   |      1    |10.0.2.1  | master
|   B   |      2    |10.0.2.14 | master
|   C   |      3    |10.0.2.30 | slave
|   D   |      4    |10.0.2.22 | slave
|=======================================

NOTE: Substitute your own settings as appropriate.

**TCP port used for replication**; this port will need to be open on all hosts:

`13000`

**Configuration file name**:

`multiHost.yaml`

The cluster configuration in `multiHost.yaml` would be:

[source,yaml]
....
  clusterConfig: !Clusters {
    myCluster: {
      config: !ReplicatedMapCfg {
        entries: 10000,
        keyClass: !type long,
        exampleKey: 17,
        name: stress-test-map,
        keysAreConstantSize: true,
        valuesAreConstantSize: false,
        keyDataAccess: !LongDataAccess {
        },
        keyReader: !LongMarshaller {
        },
      },
      topology: {
        context: !MapClusterContext {
          wireType: TEXT,
        },
        hostA: {
          hostId: 1,
          connectUri: "10.0.2.1:13000"
        },
        hostB: {
          hostId: 2,
          connectUri: "10.0.2.14:13000"
        },
        hostC: {
          hostId: 3,
          connectUri: "10.0.2.30:13000"
        },
        hostD: {
          hostId: 4,
          connectUri: "10.0.2.22:13000"
        }
      },
      monitoring: {
        replicationEventListener: !LoggingReplicationEventListener
      }
    }
....

=== Packaging the test

To run the test on remote machines, the stress test can be packaged up using the following command:

[source,bash]
....
$ ./package_stress_test.sh
....

This command generates a `tar` archive in the current directory, containing everything required to run a stress test.

Copy the resulting `tar` file to the remote server, unpack using `tar xf`, and then run the following command:

[source,bash]
....
./run_stress_test.sh -c [config-file]
....

To run the example multi-machine configuration described above, the following commands would be run on each host:

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|=======================================
| host  |  host_id  | IP       | command
|   **A**   |      `1`    |`10.0.2.1`  | `./run_stress_test.sh -c multiHost.yaml -h 1`
|   **B**   |      `2`    |`10.0.2.14` | `./run_stress_test.sh -c multiHost.yaml -h 2`
|   **C**   |      `3`    |`10.0.2.30` | `./run_stress_test.sh -c multiHost.yaml -h 3`
|   **D**   |      `4`    |`10.0.2.22` | `./run_stress_test.sh -c multiHost.yaml -h 4`
|=======================================

== Destructive testing

There are two ways of recovering from node failure:

1. Delete previous map data, and rejoin the cluster.

2. Recover previous map data, and rejoin the cluster.

If the total dataset contains a large proportion of infrequently updated records, then it is preferable to use option 2.

If the entire key-set is updated frequently, then there is little difference between the two methods.

Both scenarios can be simulated using the stress test.

=== Delete existing data and rejoin (Option 1)

. Start one or more slave processes:

 [source,bash]
 ....
 $ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml -h 3
 ....

. Start one or more master nodes:

 [source,bash]
 ....
 $ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml -h 1
 ....

. When replication has been established, kill the slave process; for example, by using `Ctrl+c`.

. Restart the slave process (see step 1).
By default, the stress test code deletes existing map data files for the specified hosts
on startup.

 [source,bash]
 ....
 $ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml -h 3
 ....

+
There should be a noticable difference in throughput after the restart, as
the slave map receives the entire data-set from the master:

 [source,bash]
 ....
 # usual operation
 Node 3 received 1153 events/sec, 153KB/sec from remote 1

 # slave process killed and restarted

 # higher throughput as slave catches up
 Node 3 received 1646 events/sec, 234KB/sec from remote 1
 ....

=== Recover existing data and rejoin (Option 2)

The stress test can be configured, using the `-r` parameter, to recover from existing data on startup.

Perform the same procedure as in Option 1, step 4, but this time when restarting the slave client use `-r`:

[source,bash]
....
$ ./run_stress_test.sh -c src/main/resources/singleMasterStressTest.yaml -h 3 -r
....

This ensures that the existing map is recovered from disk. This may save network traffic, depending on how much data has been updated in the master map during downtime.
